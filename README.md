# Sauce Trial

## Design choice

I choose to use an express boilerplate, thinking that I would need a lot more backend operations. I regret doing so. I could have been 10x leaner with a simple node server.

The front-end is a simple react app with very little effort in visual design.

## Run

Pretty straight forward

```bash
cd ui
npm i 
npm start

cd server
npm i
npm run dev
```
